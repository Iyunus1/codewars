 This finds the most common characters in a string. The first for loop assigns the character and 1 to an object if there's another character it + 1 
 e.g hello h : 1, e : 1, l : 2, o : 1, These key:value pairs are added to the charMap object.

 The second loop goes through this object and condition checks if the letter has a number higher than 0 if it does it then adds that number to the count
 of 0 and makes the maxChar the letter and goes through each one if the value currently is bigger than the previous one it becomes the new maxChar therefore
 finding the character that occurs the most in the string


 function maxCharacter(str){
     //map + count + maxChar
     let charMap = {},
      count = 0,
       maxChar = null

     //map for chars in str + freq
     for(const char of str){
       charMap[char] = charMap[char] + 1 || 1
     }
     //loop and find most freq char
     for(const char in charMap){
       if(charMap[char] > count){
         count = charMap[char]
         maxChar = char
       }
     }

     return maxChar
   }
  console.log( maxCharacter('Hello World!'), 'l')
